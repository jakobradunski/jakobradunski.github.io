My Portfolio Website where I showcase my projects and where you can contact me!

Over at https://jakobradunski.github.io is my portfolio website, which as of now features very little, aside from a live demo of my Random Color Generator Website.
Though it is barebones for now, I plan to introduce more projects and content.

This website is also a very good way to practice and learn, like implementing ReactJS in the near future.
While that will be a lot of code rewriting, it will also be a good task to complete.

Hope you enjoy!
